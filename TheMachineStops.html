	<h1>The Machine Stops (2021)</h1>
	<h2>for flute, piano and video-conferencing platform ~10'</h2>
	<p>pre-recorded or live</p>
		<h2>Program Note </h2>
		<p><i>The Machine Stops</i>, for flute and piano (optionally socially distanced) is inspired by E. M. Forster’s science fiction story of the same title (1909). Forster’s dystopian vision is one of a global engineering failure which many people have likened to the Covid-19 pandemic. This work was written for an opportunity specific to the pandemic and was written shortly after the Texas power crisis of 2021. During the ice storms I also discovered Forster's story. This piece expresses the anxieties I had with both crises while I was an international student in Texas, and the pleasure I had reading The Machine Stops for the first time. </p>
