	<h1>Gaudy (2019)</h1>
	<h2>for open instrumentation, four players ~6'</h2>
	<h2>Program Note </h2>
		<p>Gaudy was originally a plan for an electronic work. I later adapted the initial sketch into a graphic score. I decided that the gestures which I had in mind were so broad and contrasting that the did not need to be realized in a specific way. Instead they could be the basis for improvisation.</p>
