	<h1>Masstones (2018)</h1>
	<h2>for string quartet ~8'</h2>
	<h2>Program Note </h2>
		<p>A Mass-Tone is a pigment in its purest form, painted evenly over a large area. Most often they are painted for the purpose of revealing certain attributes of their pigment such as its luster, consistency or intensity. This work was composed for the Domaine Forget Composition Workshop and for the Ensemble-in-residence Quatuor Bozzini.</p>
