	<h1>Surfaces (2018)</h1>
	<h2>for violin duo ~4'</h2>
	<h2>Program Note </h2>
		<p><i>Surfaces</i> is a work for two violins which I wrote mostly to challenge myself as a composer in a specific way. I wanted to create music of emotional depth out of textures and colors which have more potential for decoration. My solution was to explore silence more ambitiously and to separate the work into discrete fragments. By isolating short sections of music in time I offer the listener a method of savoring gesture and sound. The piece is intended for a small, intimate performance space.</p>
