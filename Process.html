	<h2>for Celesta ~3'</h2>
		<h2>Program Note </h2>
<p><i>Process</i> (2021) was written many years prior to its arrangement for Celesta. It is organized as seven phrases of thirteen events. Each event is determined by chance, and each phrase has a progressively larger gamut of sounds to draw from. It is a 
process of revealing.
