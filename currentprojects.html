<h1>Current Projects</h1>
<h2>Healer for Saxophone and Fixed Media</h2>
	<p>From now until November I will be working with saxophonist <b>Nathan Robinson</b> on a short piece about healing and high fantasy. 
	<br>I am exploring the sonic language of video-games and the aesthetics of role playing games. My working concept is that the listener is experiencing what it is like to be magically healed by the performer.
	<br>This project is part of the peer-led proffesional development workshop Timbre organized by New Music Mosaic.</p>
<h1>Upcoming Performances/Releases</h1>
<h2>ATMI National Convention</h2>
<p><b>Robin Meiksins</b> will be performing <i>CHIRP</i> (2023) for piccolo and electronics. This piece was premiered by Robin last year at the SPLICE institute at Western Michigan University. 
<br>This year's convention will be held at the Washington Hilton in early November.</p>
<h2>Vox Novus</h2>
<p>This organization regularly holds concerts of miniatures titled 15-minutes-of-fame. I have one 15-m-o-f premiere upcoming, my work <i>Ground</i> (2024) for accordion will be played by <b>Stas Venglevski in May of 2025</b>.
<br>Also <b>David Bohn</b> may be releasing recordings of taishōgoto pieces, which didn't quite make the cut for a 15-m-o-f last year, among them my miniature <i>Volta</i> (2023).
<br>Date TBD.</p>
<h2>Research on Contemporary Composition Conference</h2>
<p>My piece <i>Only Text</i> (2023) for fixed media will be presented at this conference in Dahlonega, Georgia at the University of North Georgia. It will essentially be the work's premiere though it has already been released online. 
<br>The performance date is Oct.24th.</p>
