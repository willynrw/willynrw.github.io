<h1>Current Projects</h1>
<h2>Rastrum for soloist and video score</h2>
	<p>Over the summer I will be working with multi-instrumentalist <b>Gage Salnikowski</b> on a piece for solo improviser and video score. 
	<br>I am working on a graphic score in Processing and Jitter which will be ready by and projected alongside Gage. 
	<br>We have received partial funding for this project from the Manitoba Arts Council.</p>
<h2>Gott for organ</h2>
	<p> I have started to go through Charles Sandford Terry's collection of J.S. Bach's four-part chorales. I am going through each chorale and cataloging every chord that Bach wrote to accompany the word "Gott." I am hoping that a simple musical presentation of these chords can function as a conceptual piece.
	<br>Below is a recording of me playing through chords from the first 18 chorales. I give at least 15" to each chord and break up each 'chorale' with silences of about 5". Playing through the first 405 chorales in this way would take almost 3 hours.</p>

<br>Also <b>David Bohn</b> may be releasing recordings of taishōgoto pieces, which didn't quite make the cut for a 15-m-o-f last year, among them my miniature <i>Volta</i> (2023).
