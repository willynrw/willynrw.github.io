<h1>Current Projects</h1>
<h2>Rastrum for soloist and video score</h2>
	<p>Over the summer I will be working with multi-instrumentalist <b>Gage Salnikowski</b> on a piece for solo improviser and video score. 
	<br>I am working on a graphic score in Processing and Jitter which will be ready by and projected alongside Gage. 
	<br>We have received partial funding for this project from the Manitoba Arts Council.</p>
<h2>Gott for organ</h2>
	<p> I have started to go through Charles Sandford Terry's collection of J.S. Bach's four-part chorales. I am going through each chorale and cataloging every chord that Bach wrote to accompany the word "Gott." I am hoping that a simple musical presentation of these chords can function as a conceptual piece.
	<br>Below is a recording of me playing through chords from the first 18 chorales. I give at least 15" to each chord and break up each 'chorale' with silences of about 5". Playing through the first 405 chorales in this way would take almost 3 hours.</p>

<h1>Upcoming Performances</h1>
<h2>ATMI National Convention</h2>
<p><b>Robin Meiksins</b> will be performing <i>CHIRP</i>(2023) for piccolo and electronics. This piece was premiered by Robin last year at the SPLICE institute and <b>Lea Baumert-Patterson</b> performed one other time this spring at SEAMUS. 
<br>This year's convention will be held at the Washington Hilton in early November.</p>
<h2>Vox Novus</h2>
<p>This organization regularly holds concerts of miniatures titled 15-minutes-of-fame, which involve calls for scores that are free to submit to. I have one 15-m-o-f premiere upcoming, my work <i>Ground</i> for accordion will be played by <b>Stas Venglevski</b>
<br>Also <b>David Bohn</b> may be releasing recordings of taishogoto pieces which didn't quite make the cut for his call last year, among them my miniature <i>Volta</i>.
<br>I have no dates for either opportunity yet</p>
<h2>Sound of the Anthropocene</h2>
<p>My miniature <i>Good Boy</i>(2023) for fixed media will be presented at an online exhibition based in Cologne, Germany. It will be presented alongside the works of more than fifty other sound artists, from around the world. 
<br>This will be ongoing from July 13th into mid August.</p>
