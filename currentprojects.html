<h1>Current Projects</h1>
<h2>Rastrum for soloist and video score</h2>
	<p>Over the summer I will be working with multi-instrumentalist <b>Gage Salnikowski</b> on a piece for solo improviser and video score. 
	<br>The score will also be projected alongside the performer. 
	<br>We have recently received partial funding from the Manitoba Arts Council to start and document this inter-disciplinary project.</p>
<h2>Gott for organ</h2>
	<p> I have started to go through Charles Sandford Terry's collection of the J.S. Bach's four part chorales. And I would like to make a piece which catalogs every chord that Bach wrote to accompany the word "Gott" in these pieces. I am not sure whether this will be a monumental piece which I mount at a later date, or short-form content to release on my social media. 	<br>Of the first 405 chorales more than half of them contain the word at least once. Some chorales have as many as seven different chords set to the word.
	<br>Below is a recording of me playing through chords from the first 18 chorales. I give at least 15" to each chord and break up each 'chorale' with silences of about 5".</p>

<h1>Upcoming Performances</h1>
<h2>ATMI National Convention</h2>
<p><b>Robin Meiksins</b> will be performing <i>CHIRP</i>(2023) for piccolo and electronics. This will be the third performance of this piece and my second time working with Robin who premiered it over a year ago. This year's convention will be held at the Washington Hilton in early November.</p>
<h2>Vox Novus</h2>
<p>In a 15 minutes of fame broadcast <b>Stas Venglevski</b> will be premiering my piece <i>Ground</i>(2024) for accordion. This will be my third 15 minutes of fame. Also, <b>David Bohn</b> will be recording my work <i>Volta</i> for taishogoto, which I submitted to his call in 2022. I have no dates for either performance yet. 
<h2>Sound of the Anthropocene</h2>
<p>My miniature <i>Good Boy</i>(2023) for fixed media will likely be presented at an online gallery based in Cologne, Germany. From what information I have, it will be presented alongside the works of more than fifty other sound artists, from around the world. This will be an ongoing presentation from July 13th into mid August.
