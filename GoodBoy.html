	<h1>Good Boy (2023)</h1>
	<h2>for 2-channel audio ~1'</h2>
		<h2>Program Note </h2>
		<p><i>Good Boy</i> (2023) is a short work for fixed media which shares material with my work <i>Pastorale</i> for viola and electronics. It consists of sounds which humans make to play with animals, specifically dogs, and how those sounds can be grouped based on their sonic content. There isn't a dog in this piece, however.</p>
	<h2>Performances</h2>
		<p>08.11.24 - 09.08.24 . <b>Sound of the Anthropocene: 3rd Unity of Interactive Installation</b> . The Anthropocene Project . SoundLAB, The Museum of Networked Art . Cologne . DE</p>
