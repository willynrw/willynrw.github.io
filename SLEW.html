	<h1>SLEW (2019)</h1>
	<h2>for orchestra ~7'</h2>
		<p>2.2.2.2 - 4.3.3.1 - timp - strings</p>
	<h2>Program Note </h2>
		<p><i>SLEW</i> was conceived in January of 2019 after I had become accustomed to the sounds of my modular synthesizer. I was enamored with the impossibly slow changes of frequency, tone, and timbre that the instrument could create. The following March I analyzed a recording of my synth in Spear and attempted to orchestrate my findings. It is an instrumental-synthesis project similar to my works <i>Fade</i>(2018) and <i>Fuchsine</i>(2019) which used piano and clarinet recordings respectively.</p>
		<p><i>SLEW</i> was premiered by the Fort Worth Symphony Orchestra, in collaboration with the University of North Texas, College of Music, Division of Composition Studies</p>
