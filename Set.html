	<h1>Set (2023)</h1>
	<h2>for Korg Monotron Delay ~8'</h2>
		<h2>Performance Note/Score </h2>
		<p>[1.1] Connect the headphone out of a Korg Monotron Delay to two speakers via TRS-TS. 
<br>[1.2] Before turning on the KMD set the feedback to maximum, have the LPF and 
volume all the way down, and have the delay time set to its longest. 
<br>[1.3] Turn the KMD on and slowly turn up the volume revealing the noise floor. 
<br>[2.1] Slowly raise the LPF such that frequencies of noise get caught in the delay and 
compound. Stop around 1000Hz. 
<br>[2.2] Slowly shorten the delay time. 
<br>[2.3] Once the delay time is <1/2", suddenly turn the delay time to shortest and open 
the filter all the way. 
<br>[2.4] Over the span of ~2" turn the delay time and filter back to mid-range, capturing 
some sort of rhythmic pattern. Ride it for a while. 
<br>[2.5] Suddenly slow down the delay time to its maximum. 
<br>[3.1] Slowly remove feedback and close the LPF all the way. 
<br>[3.2] Turn down the volume and turn off the KMD. </p>
