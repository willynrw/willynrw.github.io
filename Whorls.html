	<h1>Whorls (2020)</h1>
	<h2>for bass flute ~5'</h2>
	<h2>Program Note </h2>
		<p>The gestures and motifs in <i>Whorls</i> were inspired by spatial and visual experiences related to spiraling and concentric circles. The sensation of tumbling or spiraling, although rarely experienced is often vividly imagined or dreamed, when we no longer have enough stimulus to orient ourselves. Concentric circles are patterns observed in nature, but also the mind is compelled to imagine them when presented with a perfect circle (the moon on a clear night for example).</p>
