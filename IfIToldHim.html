	<h1>If I Told Him (2021)</h1>
	<h2>for soprano, alto, tenor and bass voices ~7'</h2>
	<h2>Program Note </h2>
		<p><i>If I Told Him</i> (2021) is a setting of Gertrude Stein’s poem <i>If I Told Him: A Complete Portrait of Pablo Picasso</i> (1924). The poem is a series of contrasting stanzas in free verse. 
Words are repeated and rearranged throughout the text to alter the listener’s perception 
of language, taking on an almost motivic role. I tried to acknowledge these observations 
in my setting. The poem is in fact Stein’s second literary portrait of Pablo Picasso. The first 
was written in 1907 in response to Picasso’s portrait of her (1906). 
This <br>work was composed for zFestival, a virtual new music festival, in the summer of 
2021 and was first premiered by Sarah Richards, Kristina Boerger, Thom Baker and Russell 
Holbert.
