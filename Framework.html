	<h1>Framework (2020)</h1>
	<h2>for orchestra ~4'</h2>
		<p>1.picc.2.2.2 - 4.3.3.1 - timp.perc(1):t.bells - strings</p>
	<h2>Program Note </h2>
		<p><i>Framework</i> consists of two layers of music: one which is slowly descending, the other ascending. in both layers voices gently enter and exit at different rates of speed, subtly changing the orchestra's color over a brief four minutes. <i>Framework</i> is also the first in a series of pieces for varying instrumentation which all focus on a dichotomy between chronometric and lived time.</p>
		<p>This piece was premiered by the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra as part of the Winnipeg New Music Festival Composer's Institute of 2024.</p>
