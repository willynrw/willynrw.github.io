	<h1>Pastorale (2022)</h1>
	<h2>for viola and 2-channel fixed media ~6'</h2>
	<h2>Program Note </h2>
		<p>To many the Viola in movement two of Antonio Vivaldi’s Spring is simply imitating the sound of the goat-herd’s dog barking. This is not just any dog, however, but an idealized dog, one that exists only in memory or perhaps doesn’t exist at all. The Viola line is also more than a sonic object but a role. Its bassline portraying something of the dog’s faithfulness to its master. In this way Vivaldi not only zoomorphizes the Violist but anthropomorphizes the dog. Another interpretation could be that the dog is simply holding the bassline because it is physically below us and we the listener are the goatherd.</p>
 

<p>In <i>Pastorale</i> (2022) I try to articulate how this movement not only describes a human-animal relationship but power dynamics between people.

<br>Moreover, I want to explore how these dynamics can be subverted through a musical project.</p>
