	<h2>Program Note </h2>
		<p>At the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, in the fourth semester of my doctoral degree in composition while transitioning to online classes, and quarantining in my studio apartment, I decided to buy a toy piano. I found comfort in its cheapness, its limitations, and how it managed to destroy the pretentions of western classical instruments. I wrote many small pieces which failed to capture my impressions of this instrument, until the summer of 2021, when I collated a number of these sketches into a piece. I titled the piece <i>Décor</i> because my toy piano is a piece of decoration in my home.</p>
