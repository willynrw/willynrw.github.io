	<h1>Sugar Rush (2020)</h1>
	<h2>for flute ~3'</h2>
		<h2>Program Note </h2>
		<p>This piece was written for UNT Composers Forum’s 24|24 concert of 2020. It was written in 24 hours and written to be rehearsed within 24 hours. I was eating a lot of 
Halloween candy during the process of composition, which inspired the piece’s title.</p>
