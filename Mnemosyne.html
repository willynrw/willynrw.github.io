	<h1>Mnemosyne (2016)</h1>
	<h2>for clarinet in B♭, violin and piano ~9'</h2>
	<h2>Program Note </h2>
		<p>Before I found the title for Mnemosyne, my only goal was to create a piece of 
music that was more poetic than dialectic. Along the way I realized that the new 
narrative I had found was not unlike the recounting of an experience. I consider it a 
piece about memory.</p>
