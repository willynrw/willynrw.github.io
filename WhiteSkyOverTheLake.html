	<h1>White Sky Over the Lake (2020)</h1>
	<h2>for percussion and electronics ~7â€™</h2>
		<p>pitched metals (variable, 1 player), generative score and 2-channel audio</p>
	<h2>Program Note </h2>
		<p><i>White Sky Over the Lake</i> is a generative piece for soloist and electronics. Although the instrumentation is variable it is limited to mallet percussion and keyboard instruments to complement the electronic accompaniment. The performer reads a score which is generated in real time along-side an accompaniment that is also freely generated.</p>

<p>Imagine a nearly still body of water and an empty sky. It is not obvious to the eyes where they meet, or even if they are separate things.</p>
