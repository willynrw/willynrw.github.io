	<h1>Outline (2023)</h1>
	<h2>for 2-channel audio and video ~1.5'</h2>
		<h2>Program Note </h2>
		<p><i>Outline</i> is a short audiovisual work made for the 19th International Workshop on Computer Music and Audio Technology. Though it may be the start of a larger project, several pieces on the same title. It’s a direct translation of one of my pre-compositional, graph paper, drafts for a piece which didn’t come to fruition. The sketch is dated 2018 and this work was made five years later.
